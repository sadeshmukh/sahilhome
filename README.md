# Sahil Homepage

This is my homepage, built with Astro and Cursor. You can read more about the creation process [here](https://blog.sahil.ink/writing-with-cursor).

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

This starts a development server at `http://localhost:4321` that hot-reloads as you make changes.

## Deployment

Modify the `wrangler.toml` file with your own project details, or configure your own static hosting provider to automatically deploy from `/dist`.

```bash
npm run build
```
